A list of classes referencing the same visual styles could be returned to promote reuse within a codebase.\n\nSite checker. You could compare two different sites and get back and object that contained all of the unique css for each codebase in regards to rules (property value pairs).\n\nCould compare the top 1000 sites on alexa and show the list of unique css amongst all of them vs the css that each site contains.",
